Craft Builder for Michael Fogleman's Craft

Uses python default libraries including Tkinter so should run on most systems with python. If there are any issues let me know.

To be able to add geometric shapes to the canvas you should have builder.py(from https://github.com/fogleman/Craft) in the same directory as this file, as this calls functions directly from builder.py. 
If the file is not present in the directory, the option to add geometric shapes will not be available

Note: This is a top down perspective. Origin is bottom-left of grid with x increasing upward on the grid and z increasing rightward on the grid. Increasing y is by achieved by adding levels to the grid. 

To paste items on the world maps of connected severs, ensure you are facing the direction of x increasing in front of you and z increasing to the right of you to select the correct origin on the map (x,y,z) to add your model


To connect to server and access server world:
1. craftBuilder.py - Fill in details HOSTNAME, PORT, USERNAME, TOKEN(if None will read from auth.db) 
2. craftBuilder.py - Fill in DB_DIR as your path to where the client databases are store. 'e.g /users/xxxx/Craft/'
3. craftBuilder.py - NUMPERSEC - number of block messages to be sent per second. Increasing this will probably overload the server if you have a large build
